#abstract: This work brings to light some anabelian behaviours of analytic curves in the context of Berkovich geometry. We show that the #knowledge of the tempered fundamental group of some curves called analytically anabelian determines their analytic skeletons as graphs. The #famous Drinfeld half-plane is an example of such a curve. The tempered fundamental group of a Berkovich space, introduced by André, enabled #Mochizuki to prove the first anabelian result in Berkovich geometry, dealing with analytifications of hyperbolic curves over Qp. To that #end, Mochizuki develops the language of semi-graphs of anabelioids and temperoids. Our work consists in associating a semi-graph of #anabelioids to a Berkovich curve equipped with a minimal triangulation and in adapting the results of Mochizuki in order to recover the #analytic skeleton of the curve. The novelty of this anabelian result lies in the fact that the curves we are interested in are no longer #supposed to be of algebraic nature. Finally, combining some results of resolution of non-singularities to some fine study of decomposition #sets of p-torsors and associated harmonic cochains, we obtain some result of partial anabelianity of lenghts of annuli.
